# Student Management System

## Overview
This is a  Django-based Student Management System  designed to manage students, professors, courses, and grades in an academic setting. It leverages Django's ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database, providing models to store information about students, courses, professors, and scores. The system also includes authentication, permissions, and session management through Django's built-in models.

## Features

-  Course Management : Manage course offerings, including course names, schedules, and semesters.
-  Professor Management : Manage professor profiles, including contact details and teaching assignments.
-  Score Tracking : Track student performance by associating grades with specific courses and exams.
-  Authentication and Permissions : Uses Django's built-in authentication system for secure access control.
-  Admin Interface : Manage data through Django's powerful admin interface.
